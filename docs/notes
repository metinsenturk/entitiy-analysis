-Information Extraction: Identify phrases in language that refer to specific type of entities and relations in text
-Named Entity Recognition: Extract pieces of information (subset of identifying names of people, places, organizations, etc.) 
relevant to a specific application
-Knowledge based NER (regular expressions)
-Learning NER (supervised and unsupervised methods)

word2vec: 2 layer NN, pre-trained model, creates array for each word, e.g. King [0.5,0.7] and Queen [0.3,0.9] where each dimension 
encodes difference in gender or title and magnitude represents the relevance to word
GloVe: Global Vectors, count based, co-occurence matrix of words by context 

Use 2 recurrent networks: Encoder and Decoder, for each sequence
Encoder: input sequence -> represents with matrix 
Decoder: decodes matrix -> predicts -> use as encoder -> decode until reach a headline
- output word computes a weight for input words

He explains word2vec and GloVe but uses GloVe. 



Paragraph -> program finds the entities -> tells user the entities  
-	Question -> answer 

If question:
	Answer
Elif entity_inquiry:
	Entity
Else:
	Please include more information

Datasets:
Entities (maybe GloVe has included)
Dataset to use to correlate words/meaning to get train entities (for question/answer)
